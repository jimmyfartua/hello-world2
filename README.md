My cats names are JimmyJohn and Bruiser.
Git is hard for me to understand.
UFC on fox is on tonight, i'm watching. 
Francis Nganu just knocked out Andre Arlovski.
Donald Cerrone is about to fight Jorge Masvidal.
I am from Alpine UT.  I operate and own a food truck called Sweeto Burrito.  
Next fight is Pena vs Schevchenko, my prediction is Shevchenko by TKO.
Shevchenko won by arm bar in the second round.
My favorite Star Wars is Empire Strikes back.
My favorite batman is The Dark Knight.
I can't stand Harry Potter.
I can only watch the LOTR trilogy once every 10 years.  They are just too long for me.
